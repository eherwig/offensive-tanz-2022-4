Again the public expression of something can be stronger than the thing itself. The public statement and dissemination has the power of expanding, spreading and impacting. Therefore transforming expression into a political tool. Power is an ability, as a child and teenager I had the power to dance in the street of Cairo, I was full of that power, it nourished me, but could I really dance in the street? No. I did not have the authority to implement the power that I had, to put it into action, to allow it to happen. Someone else had - and still has - that authority, the authority to permit my power to be implemented, and to permit such acts in general. I could not dance or create street performances for most of my career - although it was my dream with Theatre of the Oppressed in Egypt - because there was a so called emergency law that lasted for 35 years - and until the revolution of 2011 -, and that did not authorise street performances and listed them as public political acts. No distinction between a protest or a dance act. Anybody who had the power and the disposition to act upon something, needed an authorisation. Authority, authorised and authorisation.",

        "content": "But who had the power to authorise? Who had the power to authorise the power? Of course it was the state, the regime, the government, the legal and judiciary systems, the religious institutions, the parents, the teachers, the spiritual leaders, the political leaders, the chief of the political party, the intendant of the theatre. Authority was a way to instrumentalise power, to filter it, to exploit it and to subjugate it. There was no power then in reality. But only authority. Does this apply to Germany? To Europe? Does it apply to democratic states? In my opinion the concept of authority applies anywhere and anytime, as it is a pre-requisite for governance. There is no governance without authority. But when democracy is claimed and retrieved, authority can perhaps be achieved with transparency and equality, transparency and equality being principles and protective measures at the same time. The legitimacy of those who hold authority, who hold the power to authorise, is made valid via elections, advocacy, public discussion, justice and transparency. Hence the legitimacy becomes itself authorised by the people. And only then, when we are in such a situation, we can question the mentality of the people and their system of thinking. Our overall systems of thinking are ruled by notions of normativity and normality. Those notions are not independent from our universal histories of oppression, discrimination and hierarchy. Those notions are not innocent. Like all the fields of ethics and morality, they are contaminated by a traumatic history of what is \u201cnormal\u201d, what is \u201cacceptable\u201d, what is \u201cin order\u201d and what is \u201cout of order\u201d, what is \u201cbeautiful\u201d and what is \u201cugly\u201d, what is \u201csuperior\u201d and what is \u201cinferior\u201d. This universal history would not have survived till nowadays - because it is alive until now - if it was not for pedagogy. Pedagogy is the tool to protect the norms, the ruling ethics, and the constitution of personality and identity. Pedagogy, the overall field of the transfer of knowledge, the overall learning systems, whatever shapes and informs our understanding of the world and of ourselves since we are born. This pedagogy is the safeguard of authority. It is the safeguard of the power of authorisation. Therefore knowledge, traditions and norms are transmitted from one generation to the other, and preserved via pedagogy. Yet pedagogy in itself can be anything and everything, it can be a chaotic pedagogy, a secular pedagogy or a religious pedagogy, an oppressive pedagogy or a liberating and empowering pedagogy.",

        "content": "For each ideology and system of governance there is a suitable pedagogy. Nonetheless, pedagogy can also be reversed through extraordinary and long time efforts. It can be reversed from oppressive to liberating, and vice-versa. Again the authority holds the key to both directions. Paulo Freire (great thinker, educator and philosopher) and Augusto Boal (the founder of Theatre of the Oppressed methodology) worked hand in hand to transform the pedagogy of the oppressive and turn it into a pedagogy of the self-liberated. The authoritarian system in Brazil back then - in other words \u201cthe dictatorship\u201d- had guaranteed its life via a pedagogy of oppression. In 1968 Paulo Freire created a foundational text of critical pedagogy, his celebrated book \u201cPedagogy of the Oppressed\u201d, where he includes a detailed <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marxist_analysis\">Marxist</a> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_analysis\">class analysis</a> in his exploration of the relationship between the colonizer and the colonized. In the book, Freire calls traditional pedagogy the \"<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banking_model_of_education\">banking model of education</a>\" because it treats the student as an empty vessel to be filled with knowledge. He argues that pedagogy should instead treat the learner as a co-creator of knowledge.",

For example, the oppressive pedagogies - existing in many places across the world - would instrumentalise the citizens by making them reproduce the systems of their own oppression. As I once said about Egypt, it is not enough to remove the head of the regime, we must work as citizens towards changing our own system of thinking, otherwise we risk reproducing the same oppression again and again. Therefore the long battle for change and equality is the one taking place within the field of pedagogy.",

Democracy in itself is not enough if the overall thinking and convictions of the majority are not based in equality and justice. It is a long process of questioning and re-examining that brings us here today, brings us together, and brings us to the field of performance for youth or for young audiences.

And while the privileged socio-economic class always helps to escape authority by belonging to those who create the rules and laws, those who are economically deprived become social outcasts. It is all connected. Intersectionality is not a new invention that we have woken up to, it has always been there, in its negative history and its positive potentiality. To think in an intersectional way is to expand our understanding of our identities and of the world we live in, it is to re-think the principle notions of our work and life, and to re-define them as connected and interwoven. It is also to think of the intersectionality between the stage and human rights and the global growing aggression towards children that we need to address in all its complexity and sensitivity, because even children in Kitas recently appear to have been enduring traumatic experience, although in quite rare cases, but nonetheless crucial for the building of awareness towards self autonomy, protection and rights.",

It is a movement where there is no separation between artistic creativity and activism, because collective actions that have a clear target and a strategy are activism. Beyond the traditional image of protests and demonstrations, we - as artists - can create our own form of activism. With only one letter distinguishing one from the other, ART and ACT, we can transform and develop our ideas, responses, proposals towards creating a plan of passing acts on, where each person/institution can expand the question/statement and extend it by a future symbolic or artistic action. Let us aim for questioning as a foundation of any future act, and let us aim for doing more. Let us aim to play it all together. Let\u2019s play!",
