What is it that concerns them, how do they feel, what does it mean for them to no longer be able to allow closeness and touch as a matter of course? And what role does dance and movement play in this time?",

The result is a touching film in which Fravia, Ella and Josef tell their very individual stories and give a face to the different feelings in connection with Corona through their words and movements. No matter if you are dance-loving or not, young or old -- nobody should miss this film, it gives us a wonderful insight into this young generation.",
