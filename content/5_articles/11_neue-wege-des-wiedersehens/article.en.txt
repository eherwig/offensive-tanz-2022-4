Encounters outside the usual theater spaces, in places where people can be confronted with dance in their everyday lives and be positively surprised. Despite possible fear of contact, these encounters should create moments of belonging. Performances, bouncy castle choreographies, or playground guerrillas - all this will take place in the future under the label \"Raus Gehen\" (Get Out) and turn places like schools, playgrounds, public places and parks, youth and shopping centers into places of dance. If it is not possible to find young spectators there directly, multipliers such as families, relatives and/or teachers will be found. Dance is given a public face and moves out of the bubble of its art context. The offensive dance actions also include further education and training for teachers.",

The group is now working on a new short version of the dance piece, which will eventually be performed in public space. From the original cast, two of the performers will meet with two newcomers via the video conferencing platform \"Zoom\" and rehearse exclusively digitally. Thus, one of the \"old\" performers and one of the newcomers will meet for the first time in real space, with the audience present - making the live moment all the more intense.",
