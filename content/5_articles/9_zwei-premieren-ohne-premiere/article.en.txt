Actually, in this context we would have celebrated not only our first birthday as Offensive Tanz, but also two wonderful premieres: \"<a href=\"https://offensive-tanz.de/en/events/a-human-race\">A Human Race</a>\", produced by TANZKOMPLIZEN, as well as \"<a href=\"https://offensive-tanz.de/en/events/strange-garden\">Strange Garden</a>\", a co-production of PURPLE Dance Festival. Both dance pieces could not be performed in front of an audience due to the Corona situation. When exactly this will be the case remains uncertain. What is it like to work as a choreographer under such circumstances, what happens to the production, your personal creativity and your own motivation? We talked about this with Grichka Caruge (\"A Human Race\") and Colette Sadler (\"Strange Garden\").",

On the other hand there is a kind of silver lining to all this because with our work we are creating a bubble of light in this dark period. We are able to do something and this chance inspires creativity. We are trying to transform our experiences into positivity,\" says Grishka about the work during the pandemic. The Krump piece \"A Human Race\" comes with a lot of physical contact; regular Corona tests were essential for rehearsals. Another challenge: Most of the five dancers are not from Germany. \"We didn\u2019t know \u2013 some of us are not from Germany \u2013 will the borders be closed? Do we have to go home? Can we come back again? But in a way all this frustration is good for Krump because Krump needs challenges and friction. Krump was born from this.\"",

When you are creating, you always tell about what you are going through at this very moment. `A Human Race\u00b4 is a story about humanity.

But in a way, I know that the piece is heard and that it is heaving an effect.\" Colette: \"One feels the absence for sure but the choreographers heart knows that one day audience will return to theatre and at that time the love and need for live theatre will be higher.

We will certainly only understand later what actually happened to us. However, Colette can already name a few things that would probably not have developed accordingly without Corona: \"During Corona I had the chance to expand my choreographic practice into other media so into sound/video works. I also took it as a chance to expand on my curatorial practice.\" And Grichka? \"I learned that being surrounded by my family is crucial in times like this. I really couldn\u2019t stand being alone, only commuting between work and an empty flat, constantly thinking about the piece, no people on the streets, no restaurants nothing. So I brought my family here.\"",
