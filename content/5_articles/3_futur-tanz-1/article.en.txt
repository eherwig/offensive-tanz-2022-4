The development of a separate section for children's and youth theater was already driven by the same core issues that are still relevant today: children's right to cultural participation, the question of definition via the art form or via the audience, the goal of achieving higher budgets and better working conditions for the children's and youth sector, the claim to recognize the realities of children's lives and not to trivialize them. According to Fischer-Fels, establishing children's and youth theater as an independent branch helped to strengthen children's rights in general and was able to achieve a lot over the years. But even today, there are great differences to the working and budget conditions in adult theater. A separate division is therefore helpful, but not the solution to all problems.",

Many other countries, above all Belgium, the Netherlands and Scandinavia, are already much further ahead in their structures. There, the need for high-quality, participatory cultural offerings for children and young people is estimated to be higher than in Germany. In 2006, Take-off: Junger Tanz provided the first long-term structural support for dance for young audiences. This made it possible to develop initial collaborations within the scene, to strengthen cooperation with educational institutions, and to consolidate reliability and quality in the daily work for young audiences. Behind all these factors is the need for continuous funding and sufficient space.",

Young artists in particular are often interdisciplinary, as they no longer see themselves only as dancers, but also as bloggers, musicians, media professionals and participants in discourse. This makes contemporary dance a cross-disciplinary art form. With a view to the theater world, dan Droste addressed what she sees as the long-slept-in integration of dance as an art form into institutional structures. And concluded, like the previous speaker, with a plea for quality assurance and sustainability, in order to make the leap into a possible divison \"dance for young audiences\" a \"flight\" and not a \"crash landing\".",

A quota for children's and youth productions? There was agreement above all on the finding that everyone can learn from each other in development and work processes, such as the early participation of young people in the development of a piece.",

Despite the differences between dance for young audiences and dance in general, both areas share the same goals: larger funding volumes and more intensive community work. Continuity is the most important adjusting screw here, both for production and mediation, as well as for daily work and employment.",

A foundation alone, however, could not remedy these structural deficiencies. Intensive, interdisciplinary discourse continues to be important here.",

In addition to lobbying at the federal level, he said, the insight has grown to not only finance concepts, but also to implement them themselves in order to develop expertise and enable basic research. He also emphasized the importance of interdisciplinarity and permeability in dance - between professional and semi-professional artists, as well as in questions of the conquest of theater structures by dance, in order to bring their own potential into exchange at eye level.",

Dance should not be allowed to withdraw too much into its own division in order to generate sufficient visibility. To this end, funding programs are also needed at the international level to facilitate cross-border exchange between artists.",
