It was the first event that we had to cancel and postpone indefinitely. The camera recording Nora Amin's keynote speech on March 13th also captured the impressive dance performance by Raha Nejad in the middle of an empty room (recording above). Afterwards, we took the opportunity to talk to the German-Persian dancer and choreographer via call.",

It hit hard tho when the symposium in the context of Offensive Tanz was cancelled. This was very important for me personally so that day was a very emotional one. Doing the performance in the middle of this empty space of Schillertheater Werkstatt \u2013 I don't know exactly what it was. It is a feeling you cannot control. And the song that was played also did something to me.",

You also have to deal with one thing first to be able to say - ok, I understand that. Then you move on to something else. I always liked being someone who jumps between different styles. But hip hop, urban dance, that was always my priority. And then of course there is my background that I bring along, my roots. I think we are all much too busy thinking in separate boxes.

When dancing, you create your own base, your own environment. It is up to you how to communicate this. Dance enriches, it's a medicine. If we would not have art in the current situation, it would be very difficult. Artists Ary lucky, they are able to rely on something that brings joy in other people's life. That is worth a lot. Even on the day when the symposium had to be cancelled, we went home from the Schillertheater Werkstatt and I was very sad. It was a mixture of sadness, but also tenderness somewhere. Sadness and happiness merging in terms of being allowed to do what I do. I have a feeling that artists are also getting a remarkable voice in this situation. We live from ourselve's presentation and it is professionalism to make this look easy. But there is another kind of effort too, coming with a very special quality.",
