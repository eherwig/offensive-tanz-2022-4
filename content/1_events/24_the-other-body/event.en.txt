        "content": "\u201cThe Other Body?\" is a conference for dance artists and educators on the issue of dance and racism. It is an attempt to let artists, educators and spectators speak out against the labelling, objectification and de-humanisation of the dancing body, while considering the transformations of socio-political identities and the perspective of decolonisation. Central to the one-day conference is the analysis of the strategies of racism within the history of dance pedagogy and the aesthetic traditions of choreographed dance. Three sessions offer room for discussion, and a final slot opens up the possibility for performative expression.",
