When they are balanced on the palm of a hand in alignment with the dancers' own center of gravity, it creates a <strong>fascinating dynamic and concentration in the space</strong>, which transmits to an audience of all ages. The viewers sense the artists' investment of intensity and endurance in building a relationship with their material, which in turn develops a life of its own on stage.",
