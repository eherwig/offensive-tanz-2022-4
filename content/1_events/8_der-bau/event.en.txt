        "content": "A stage full of black bags. Slowly they come to life, they straighten up, move around, explore the space. Suddenly an arm appears, then a leg, finally a whole person. In Franz Kafka's unfinished story \"Der Bau,\" an animal burrow is described, built by an animal that seeks shelter in the underground caves and passages and then increasingly loses itself in them. The narrative serves as the titular metaphor and starting point for the exploration of a special relationship between body and space. The 40 malleable, large-format beanbags are the material for the group work DER BAU-Gruppe / Kids, which is shaped by 5 performers into complex structures and choreographic structures of order. As a group piece, DER BAU was initially a performance for adult audiences; for FRATZ 2020, Isabelle Schad adapted the piece for children aged 3 and up.",
