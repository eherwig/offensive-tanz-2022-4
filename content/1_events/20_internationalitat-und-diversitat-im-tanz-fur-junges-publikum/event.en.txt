Do we reproduce existing power structures by trying to break them up? How do dance and theater succeed at eye level? Among others, three FRATZ research laboratories from Berlin, Cape Town and Lagos as well as the FRATZ Atelier of Milla Koistinen, Paul Valikoski and Ladislav Zajac will present their work. On the podiums Joshua Alabi, Nora Amin, Shelley Etkin, Malgven Gerbes, Thalia Laric, Isabelle Schad, Iury Salustiano Trojaborg, Marie Yan and many more will discuss and speak.",
