Do we reproduce existing power structures by trying to break them up? How do dance and theater succeed at eye level?<br>Among others, three FRATZ research laboratories from Berlin, Cape Town and Lagos.<br>On the podiums Joshua Alabi, Nora Amin, Shelley Etkin, Malgven Gerbes, Thalia Laric, Isabelle Schad, Iury Salustiano Trojaborg, Marie Yan and many more will discuss and speak.",
