Born in the Black Community of L.A., Krump dance style is the <strong>embodiment of social inequality</strong>, a vibrant form of expression that is raw and energetic, a creative outlet for aggression that lets the wounds of exclusion and racism speak for themselves. \"A Human Race\" also shows Krump as a plea to constantly renegotiate human interaction: Struggle, anger or pain are closely linked to the possibility of developing community, empathy and cohesion.",
