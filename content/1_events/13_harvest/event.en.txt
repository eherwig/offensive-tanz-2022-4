Choreographer Isabelle Schad explores the brushwood with three dancers and a musician, creating surprising and ever-changing landscapes. Between the exploration of the material, the layering, storing, bending of the whips, twigs and branches as well as listening to the crackling and cracking in the silence, an imaginative play develops with seemingly weightless magical creatures and other small wonders that appear - and disappear again. With poetry and lightness, the ensemble explores the relationship between man and nature - but also the sound cosmos of the willows that create the rhythms for the harvest and the dance.",
