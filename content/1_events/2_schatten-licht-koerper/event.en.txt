At what point is a human being \u2014 inwardly and outwardly \u2014 inhuman? What is within us that we don't want to show? Why not? The lab will explore these questions and develop an intergenerational performative approach, focusing on the perspective of children. How free do children feel in their expressive possibilities? Where do they experience restriction and powerlessness? How can we encourage them to get to know and accept their shadow sides?",
