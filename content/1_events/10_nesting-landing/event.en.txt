In doing so, she relates her body-based artistic work on origin and arrival, on localisation and rootedness, to the lifeworld of children and their relationship to their immediate surroundings. The ground beneath our feet. Plants and animals. The city, the country, the earth, the wind.... Nature. Inside spaces, outside spaces. At home. Not at home. Presence. Arriving? Landing? Belonging?",

In an interdisciplinary working group, we will explore how our (adult) offerings can relate to children's imaginations and thought worlds, and open ourselves to their curiosities and needs. What kind of habitat could we build together and how can this process playfully deconstruct claims to ownership and territory? What dreams do we have in relation to this place and in relation to the places in our lives?",
