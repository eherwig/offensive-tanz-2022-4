        "content": "Slowly a landscape comes to life. In a state of constant transformation, the garden is populated by weird creatures that shapeshift, move, play and interact with one another. Inspired by a clash of natural and technological forms these creatures look like things we recognize from everyday life but have taken on special powers. Here in the strange garden things are not as they normally seem. If these creatures are not human like us, who or what are they? Animal, mineral or plant? Should we be frightened of them? Are they our friends?",
